## Events In Angular

- We can tell Angular to take some action whenever an event takes place within my application
- I can classify in the general case events into two categories:
    - Mouse Events 
    - Keyboard Events

### Keyboard Events and Similarity With React
- ng-change directive i.e. onChange in React
    - useful for when I want to take some action whenever a field has changed within my application
- ng-keydown directive i.e. onKeyDown in React
    - useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user hits a certain key on his keyboard
- ng-keyup directive i.e. onKeyup in React
    -useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user releases a certain key on his keyboard
- ng-keypress directive i.e. onKeyPress
    - useful for when I want to take some AS SOON AS the user presses a certain key



### Mouse Events
- ng-click directive i.e. onClick in React
    - useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user clicks on the field
- ng-dblclick directive i.e. onDoubleClick in React
    - useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user double clicks on the field
- ng-mousedown directive i.e. onMouseDown in React
    - useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user scrolls down with his mouse
- ng-mouseenter directive i.e. onMouseEnter in React
    - useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user mouse enters a certain area
- ng-mouseleave directive i.e. onMouseLeave in React
    - useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user mouse leaves a certain area
- ng-mousemove directive i.e. onMouseMove in React
   - useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user's tip of the mouse moves over a certain area
- ng-mouseover directive i.e. onMouseOver in React
    -  useful for when I want to take some action whenever the user's mouse is moved onto an element or its offspring
