## Views in Angular

- A group of elements which are born together and die together
- Element props in a view are mutable depending on the actions of the user
- Structure of elements in a view all depend on the decisions of a user 
- I can add, move or remove nested views from their container
- Views are similar to the Linked List data structure in that each node in a view 
    holds a reference to its appropriate DOM element
- Whenever angular detects a change in the state of the view it outputs the new view to the DOM
